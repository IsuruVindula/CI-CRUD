    <h3>About Us</h3>
        We strongly believe that the gift of seeing the beauty and expression of art should be an opportunity for as many people as possible; hence our primary cause is to help individuals suffering from curable cases of visual impairment or blindness. WHO estimates there to be 39 million people afflicted with blindness globally, of which 80% were preventable or are curable. Our long term mission is to reduce the number of blind people in Sri Lanka.

    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
        One of the biggest issues that I find when we review sites is sites that have no way to contact their owner or webmaster. It could be as simple as you wanting to let them know that they have a typo, or as beneficial as wanting to request a quote for their services. It is important to have multiple and thorough ways of being contacted. Also, if you are using a captcha on a contact form, test it yourself to see whether or not it is comprehensive or frustrating.

    <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
        If you are providing a service or a product, this is your chance to link to all of the good legal jargon. This is a great self-protective measure and is very important to have. Placement of this in the footer is a very standard location and users would anticipate it being there.
